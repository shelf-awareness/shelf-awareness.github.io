## Overview

Shelf Awareness is a centralized moble and web application that is designed to create a digital inventory system to keep track of items in a pantry, freezer, fridge, and spice rack. Users will be able to add, remove, and edit items. The application will also keep track of the expiration date of items and the quantity, which can generate shopping lists for items that are low in quanity, needed for a recipe, or pass its expiration date. 

The application will allow for two types of users.

* Admins can add, delete, and review recipes.
* Users can add new pantries, add, update, and delete items to their pantry, add and view recipes, create shopping lists, and view a map of nearby grocery stores.
