## Overview

Shelf Awareness is a centralized mobile and web application designed to provide a digital inventory system for managing household food storage, including pantries, refrigerators, freezers, and spice racks. The application allows users to add, remove, and edit items, while tracking item quantities and expiration dates.

Using this information, Shelf Awareness can automatically generate shopping lists for items that are running low, required for selected recipes, or nearing (or past) their expiration dates—helping users stay organized and reduce food waste.

The application will allow for two types of users.

* Admins can add, delete, and review recipes.
* Users can create and manage multiple pantries, add, update, and delete pantry items, add and view recipes, generate shopping lists, and view a map of nearby grocery stores. 

## Use Cases

* Users can generate shopping lists based on items that are expired or low in stock.
* Application will track item quanties across all storage locations.
* Use expiration reminders to suggest recipes to help reduce food waste.

## Beyond The Basics
